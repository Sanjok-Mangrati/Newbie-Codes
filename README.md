# Newbie-Codes
This repo contains all my codes that I wrote while I was learning a new language or technology.
This conatins anything from a simple practice code to minor projects built to understand and apply certain concepts I learned. 

Note: You are allowed to use all the codes inside this repository for personal or commercial use. No credit is required, though credit would be highly aprreciated.
I would be happy if my trash codes would save atleast one person's time.

XD Happy Coding!
